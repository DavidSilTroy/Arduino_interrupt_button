# Arduino buttons using an interrupt button
Here we are using 5 buttons, the interrupt button is the stop, so:

When the 100 button is pushed 
100% power for 8 seconds then shift to 75% power for  60 seconds.

When the 75 button is pushed  
75% power for 100 seconds.

When the 50 button is pushed 
50% power for 100 seconds.<

When the 25 button is pushed 
25% power for 100 seconds.

When the stop button is pushed it cancel all the others.
